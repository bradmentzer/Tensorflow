# Artificaial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

## Artificial Intelligence

Automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
Can be simple or complex

## Machine Learning

A subcatigorization of AI
Machine learning takes the data and answers and finds what the rules should be
Goal is to achieve highest accuracy

### Types of Machine Learning

- Unsupervsed learning
  - given features and the models give labels
  - ex. for a given scatterplot x,y have the model group the features into an output
- Supervised learning
  - features yield a label
  - a supervisor has training data and expected output and tweaks the algorithm for the correct output
- Reinforcement learning
  - No data, contains agent, enviorment, and reward
  - Agent gets reward for getting closer to goal and agent wants to maximize reward
    - Explores enviorment to maximize reward
    - Can you use a reinforcement model to find similarities in patient data?

## Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

A form of machine learning that used a layered representation of data
Multiple layers of data transformed before output
Multistages layer abstraction process
